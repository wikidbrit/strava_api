## Scope

This project is part of my studies at Hyper Island, that I am doing during my personal project segment. This is the 3rd project I decided to work on during this period, and one I wanted to explore react more. Specifically understand useState and useEffect more.

## Project 

Strava is an app used to track physical activities such and biking, running, swimming, etc. I learned they had a pretty robust api and decided it would be a fun project to play around with it. I have taken up biking recently as part as my physical therapy recovering from a broken leg, and having a titanium rod implanted. 

I decided to create a simple design that I could populate with data from the api and render a map that shows all my activities. On the page I display the most recent activity which includes;

- Most Recent Distance Travelled
- Most Recent Time Riding
- Most Recent Elevation Change
- Most Recent Average Speed of Ride
- Most Recent Average Heart Rate

and I track total activities (currently limited to 200);

- Total Distance Travelled
- Total Time Riding
- Number of Tracked Activities
- Total Elevation Change
- Average Speed of all rides
- Average Power output in Watts
- Average time on each ride
- Total Kudos Received
- Longest Tracked Ride

Finally I also display all the rides in an interactive map, that a user can use to view where I have been in my area.
